1. Within the "Code" directory, you may find 3 python programs.

q1 - LSTM network
q2 - BLSTM network

common - Which has all methods to run the RNN, train the network, classify the results, plot the data, Plot the confusion matrix etc.

To run any of these programs, you may just run it with python3 with no parameters required to pass to the program.

2. You may find 2 directories inside the "Code" directory. Each of these directories have all images, plots, confusion matricies, learning rates and WEIGHT files corresponding to each program.

Q1 - All files related to the LSTM network
Q2 - All files related to the BLSTM network

3. To use the weight files that are already trained, just copy paste the weight file next to the q<x>.py file (q1.py for example). If a valid weight file is found, the program will automatically pick the weight file and just classify without running any training epocs. Otherwise, it will run the epocs and generate all of these images and weight files within the corresponding directory.
