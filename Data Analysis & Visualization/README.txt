For running the file visualize_plots.py:
The program can be run using command python3 visualize_plots.py
Then the different types of plot will be shown according to the question and you need to ‘close’ the image shown each time to let the next plot start and then next plot will be shown and so on.Maximise the output image shown to get clarity of the image shown.

For running the file Single_Perceptron.py:
The program can be run using command python3 Single_Perceptron.py
Then program will ask for filename insert the filename whichever is needed
For example , you should type Frogs.csv and then it will ask whether or not you want to train the dataset you can type y for yes and n for no. In either case the program will run and show the output

For running the file Neural_Network_Hidden_layers.py:
The program can be run using command python3 Neural_Network_Hidden_layers.py
and then it will ask whether or not you want to train the dataset you can type y for yes and n for no. In either case the program will run and show the output.
The different neural network used in this program is included in the comments inside program. By default the program will run with neural network having 2 hidden layers
