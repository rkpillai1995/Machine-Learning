This folder has python files with codes for Convolutional Neural Network which also demonstrates Transfer Learning Techniques



File q1.py:
For training the nearly LeNet5 model and plotting the learning curve and accuracies execute this file with command python3 q1.py

File q2.py:
For testing the nearly LeNet5 model on FashionMNIST dataset and plotting the learning curve and accuracies execute this file with command python3 q2.py

###If you want to just test the trained model, use file test.py

File q3.py:
For training the resnet5 model and printing the accuracies execute this file with command python3 q3.py


File test.py:

If you wish to just excute the models without training then execute the file test.py

When the input is asked for file name type mnist or fashionmnist depending on which testset you want to test the model.

When the input is asked for model name type q1 if you want to use the nearly LeNet5 model. If you want to use the nearly LeNet5 model after transfer learning type q2. When the accuracies are printing you have to close every plot window to see the next plot or else program will wait till the window is closed by user.

During the execution of q1.py, q2.py and q3.py when the learning curve and accuracies are printing you have to close every plot window to see the next plot or else program will wait till the window is closed by user.
